# qdia
Simple schematic/diagram editor with focus on quick diagram generation with high quality graphics.

Inspired by xcircuit.

Initial code based on Qt/Example/diagramscne

Build with cmake and qt6.

## Status
The program has reached a useable state.
Basic circuit elements are present. Creating schematics works as well as saving/loading.
The overall useability is going to be refined.
